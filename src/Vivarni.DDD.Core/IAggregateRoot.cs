/// <summary>
/// Marker interface to mark aggregate root entities.
/// 
/// Aggregates draw a boundary around one or more Entities. An Aggregate enforces invariants
/// for all its Entities for any operation it supports.  Each Aggregate has a Root Entity,
/// which is the only member of the Aggregate that any object outside the Aggregate is allowed
/// to hold a reference to.  From Evans, the rules we need to enforce include:
/// 
///  * The root Entity has global identity and is ultimately responsible for checking invariants
///  * Root Entities have global identity.  Entities inside the boundary have local identity, unique only within the Aggregate.
///  * Nothing outside the Aggregate boundary can hold a reference to anything inside, except to the root Entity.  The root Entity can hand references to the internal Entities to other objects, but they can only use them transiently (within a single method or block).
///  * Only Aggregate Roots can be obtained directly with database queries.  Everything else must be done through traversal.
///  * Objects within the Aggregate can hold references to other Aggregate roots.
///  * A delete operation must remove everything within the Aggregate boundary all at once
///  * When a change to any object within the Aggregate boundary is committed, all invariants of the whole Aggregate must be satisfied.
///
